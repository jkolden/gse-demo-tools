# GSE Demo Tools
This code represents a sample of the PL/SQL used to support the GSE demo tools. The GSE demo tools are a series of APEX applications hosted on apex.oraclecorp.com that allow solution engineers to quickly stage demo data for various ERP subject areas, i.e. Cash Management, Credit Card Expenses and Revenue Management.

Most of the data needed to present a complete ERP demo is time-sensitive. Further, this data is typically consumed during the demo itself and therefore new and fresh data is required for each successive demo. Before these tools were created, solution engineers were required to load their demo data using FBDI (File Based Data Import) spreadsheets. This is extremely time-consuming and error-prone and can take several hours to load all the required transactions for an ERP demo. With these demo tools we can stage a demo with the click of a button.
